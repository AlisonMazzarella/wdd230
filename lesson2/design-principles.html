            <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>
            <h3>Albertina Museum</h3>

            </a>
            <p>PARC: Proximity describes how elements are placed in proximity to one another as a visual unit. This helps reduce clutter and gives structure to the information being displayed.
                The information shown also gives a clear meaning to what the user is viewing and using the website for. 
                In this case, the Albertina uses image and text proximity to group together similar exhibits and artistic styles, so the user understands what artwork they can expect at this museum.

                <img src="images/contrast.jpg" alt="PARC Contrast">
            </a>
            <p>PARC: Contrast is used to emphasize the difference between selected elements. It is often used to highlight the differences between two elements.
                However, sometimes it can also be used to direct the user's eye to what they want you to see. In this example, the fitness studio centers on pilates, and they want users attention to
                be directed at the fitness instructor's form while practicing a pilates move. Contrast creates visual interest for users.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>A Tale of Hearts</h3>
            <a href="https://www.ataleofhearts.com/">
                <img src="images/thirds.jpg" alt="Rule of Thirds">
            </a>
            <p>The Rule of Thirds is directed towards the look and layout of a design, for example, a web page or photograph
                The idea is that you place a grid over your content and try to divide it equally into thirds, both horizontally and vertically. 
                The intent is to add interest and engage the user's eyes to see what you want them to see, or, in the case of photography, to also help the user feel what you want them to feel. 
                In this case, I feel the photographer has used the Rule of Thirds to showcase their photography skills in aerial settings, like mountainscapes.
